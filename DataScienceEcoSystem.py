# Exercise 7 - Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples

# Add a line in this cell with H3 style heading with text like:


# # Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[5]:


# Exercise 8 - Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers

# In this code cell evaluate the expression (3*4)+5.
# Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
# Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of 17.


# In[6]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
(3*4)+5

# Exercise 9 - Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours

# In this code cell write an expression that converts 200 minutes into hours.
# Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
# Run the cell to evaluate the expression.


# In[8]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

200/60

# Exercise 10 - Insert a markdown cell to list Objectives

# Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3,
# insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered
# (i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). In this new cell start with an introductory line titled:
# Objectives: in bold font. Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook,
# such as List popular languages for Data Science'''


# ### Objectives:
# 
# #### List popular languages for Data Science
# 
# Create markdown tables in a Jupyter Notebook
# 
# Use a code cell for basic arithmetic operations
# 
# Convert units using a code cell
